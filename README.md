# Weekly Challenge #2 - Double Lines

**For the second challenge, you need to implement an algorithm that draws two lines side by side without overlapping. It must handle an arbitrary amount of points where each 3 consecutive points are forming a 90 degrees angle.** Note that it looks deceiptively simple but it's way harder than meet the eyes!

This is the second edition of a weekly programming challenge that I'm going to host. The idea is to spur people's creativity. I used to run this kind of contest on [SC2Mapster.com](https://sc2mapster.com/) where every week I would come up with a map concept. It worked really well for mapping competition, I figured that this format would also work for programmers, yet I've not seen this kind of challenge anywhere.

### Winners:

This week's is a tie between the two participants:

* Congratulations to @ericlee314 who wins $75 by implementing a web based version of the algorithm. It has a [nice UI](https://jsfiddle.net/ericdlee/etkcrgLf/228/) that lets you write your own path and see how it would behave. You can see the [full submission](https://github.com/vjeux/weekly-challenge-2-double-lines/issues/1).

* Congratulations to @mirellasilva who wins $75 by implementing a python version of the algorithm. The distinctive feature is the [automatically generated tests](https://github.com/mirellasilva/double-lines/blob/main/run_tests.py) which is a nice touch!
