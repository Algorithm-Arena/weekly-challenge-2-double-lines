# Weekly Challenge #2 - Double Lines

This is the second edition of a weekly programming challenge that I'm going to host. The idea is to spur people's creativity. I used to run this kind of contest on [SC2Mapster.com](https://sc2mapster.com/) where every week I would come up with a map concept. It worked really well for mapping competition, I figured that this format would also work for programmers, yet I've not seen this kind of challenge anywhere.

**For the second challenge, you need to implement an algorithm that draws two lines side by side without overlapping. It must handle an arbitrary amount of points where each 3 consecutive points are forming a 90 degrees angle.** Note that it looks deceiptively simple but it's way harder than meet the eyes!
